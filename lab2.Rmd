#Use an installed library 
# You will need to install the "lattice" package -- unless using the Lab computers
#In R go to Packages   -- select "install packages" choose a mirror and then the "lattice" package
# Now issue the following commands
library(lattice)
dotplot(I,col=mycol)

# Task 4
```{r}

title("Boxplot of mpg")

## Using Chebyshevâ€™s theorem predict the proportion of data within 2 standard deviations of the mean of the mpg data
## At least 1-1/4=3/4
3/4

## Use R to calculate the exact proportion within 2 standard deviation of the mean.
length(I[abs(z)<2])/length(I)

## Does Chebyshev agree with the data?
## yes
## use the empirical rule
## 95%
## How well does it correspond?
## Very close to 96%
## Is the Empirical rule valid in this case? Why?
## Yes, because the value of Empirical rule is approximate to the exact value.
